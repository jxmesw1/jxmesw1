<h1 align="center">👋 Hi, I'm James</h1>
<h3 align="center">A full stack developer from the UK.</h3>

<h4>About me</h4>
I concentrate on website development, both back and front end - although I love to experiment with other stuff, especially ESPs. I'm still learning so please excuse me if I get something wrong!

<h4>Good to know</h4>
🌐 My strongest languages are PHP, JS and C++, but I also have knowledge in various other languages!
<br>
🖼️ I am also highly skilled in Photoshop and XD.
<br>
🏠 I love home automation and use Home Assistant where possible!

<h4>My projects</h4>
My very first project was <a href="https://trainslive.uk">TrainsLive</a>. It was released on 1st January 2022 after a year in development - and I still work on it today. In fact, I have many exciting plans for the website - if you want to know more check out <a href="https://twitter.com/TrainsLive_">TrainsLive's Twitter</a>

<h4>Capybara Dev Co</h4>
In the near future, I would love to start a website development business. My plan is to introuce <strong>Capybara Dev Co</strong> in 2024 and work with clients to build modern yet unique websites at an affordable price.
